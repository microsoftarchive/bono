# Bono

Bono is a quantum circuit visualizer that allows you to edit quantum circuits and evalute them at real-time. It also generates [Q#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/language/?view=qsharp-preview) code that you can take and run on [Microsoft Quantum Development Kit](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/development-kit) and in the future, a real quantum computer.

Bono provides the following features:

* Pure JavaScript-based. Run offline without a web server.
* Drag-and-drop circuit editor with real-time evaluation.
* Dynamic debugging. Examine any stages of the circuit at any time. 
* Automatically generates Q# code.
* Switch among a rich set of state visualizations. 
* Completely open source.
